## Active Decisions

### Content Management Approach

The project has adopted a language-based content management approach using JSON files organized by language in the `/src/content` directory. This decision allows for:

- Easy content updates without code changes
- Clear separation of content and presentation
- Multilingual support with language-specific content files
- Dynamic content loading based on the selected language
- Potential for future expansion to a headless CMS if needed

### UI Library Integration

The project uses Material UI as the primary UI library:

- Material UI serves as the comprehensive component library
- Framer Motion provides animation capabilities
- The providers are configured to work together without conflicts
- Theme integration ensures consistent styling across components
- Motion-wrapped Material UI components (MotionBox, MotionButton, etc.) enable seamless animations

### Styling Strategy

The current styling approach combines:

- Component-based styling through Material UI props and the sx prop
- Global CSS variables for theme properties
- CSS modules for page-specific styling
- Custom components for consistent UI patterns (Section, GradientText)
- This hybrid approach balances component encapsulation with global theme consistency

### Custom Component Usage

The project emphasizes the use of custom components for consistency:

- Section component for page sections with consistent styling and animations
  ```tsx
  <Section
    id="hero"
    animation="fadeInUp"
    animationDelay={0.3}
    sx={{ /* Custom styling */ }}
  >
    {/* Content */}
  </Section>
  ```
- textWithGradient utility for gradient text formatting
  ```tsx
  <Typography>{textWithGradient("Gradient Text Example")}</Typography>
  ```
- Motion components for animated UI elements
  ```tsx
  <MotionTypography
    variant="h1"
    initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
    animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
  >
    Animated Text
  </MotionTypography>
  ```
- SpotlightCard for interactive card elements

### Language Handling Implementation

The project implements multilingual support through:

- URL-based language routing (`/en/`, `/es/`)
- Middleware for language detection and redirection
- Language context for managing language state
- JSON-based content files organized by language
- Server-side content loading based on URL parameters
- Client-side language toggle with URL updates

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Fix the typo in layout.tsx (change "asyn" to "async")
2. Optimize images and assets for better performance
3. Implement responsive design improvements for all viewport sizes
4. Enhance animations and transitions for a more polished user experience
5. Implement form validation and submission handling
6. Add analytics integration for tracking user behavior
7. Conduct accessibility audit and make necessary improvements

### Upcoming Considerations

- Performance optimization for Core Web Vitals
- Accessibility audit and improvements
- SEO optimization with additional metadata
- Analytics integration for conversion tracking
- A/B testing capability for optimizing conversion
- Integration with a backend API for form submissions

## Active Technical Considerations

### Component Architecture

- Refining the granularity of components for better reusability
- Balancing server and client components for optimal performance
- Establishing patterns for component composition and reuse
- Using custom components (Section, GradientText) for consistency

### State Management

- Currently using React Context for language, theme, and sidebar state
- Evaluating the need for more robust state management as interactive features increase
- Considering form state management with React Hook Form

### Performance Optimization

- Implementing image optimization for assets
- Evaluating code splitting strategies
- Monitoring bundle size as components are added
- Implementing lazy loading for non-critical components

## Current Challenges

### UI Library Integration

- Ensuring consistent theming across all components
- Optimizing bundle size with multiple libraries
- Balancing animation performance with visual appeal
- Managing animation complexity with reusable variants and props

### Content Strategy

- Maintaining consistent translations across all content files
- Implementing SEO best practices for multilingual content
- Establishing a workflow for content updates
- Ensuring content structure consistency between language files

### Development Workflow

- Setting up efficient local development processes
- Establishing code quality standards and review processes
- Implementing testing strategies for components and pages
- Ensuring consistent code style and documentation
- Maintaining type safety across the application
