## Technical Constraints

### Browser Compatibility

- The application targets modern browsers with good CSS Variable support.
- Responsive design ensures compatibility with various device sizes.
- Progressive enhancement ensures basic functionality on older browsers.

### Performance Considerations

- Server components are used for content-heavy sections to reduce client-side JavaScript.
- Static rendering is employed where possible for improved performance.
- Images and assets are optimized for fast loading.
- Language-specific routes are pre-rendered for faster initial loading.
- Code splitting reduces initial bundle size.

### Accessibility Requirements

- Material UI provides accessible components by default.
- Proper semantic HTML is used throughout the application.
- Color contrast meets WCAG guidelines.
- Keyboard navigation is supported for all interactive elements.
- ARIA attributes are used where appropriate.

## Dependencies and Integrations

### Key Dependencies

- **@emotion/react** and **@emotion/styled**: Styling solution
- **@mui/icons-material** and **@mui/material**: UI components and icons
- **framer-motion**: Animation library
- **next**: Core framework
- **react** and **react-dom**: UI library
- **react-hook-form**: Form management

### External Integrations

- Currently, no external API integrations are implemented.
- The application is designed to be easily extendable for future integrations.
- Language-based routing allows for potential integration with translation services.
- Form submission will eventually connect to a backend API.

## Build and Deployment Process

### Build Process

1. Code is pushed to the main branch
2. GitHub Actions workflow is triggered
3. Dependencies are installed using pnpm
4. Application is built using Next.js build process
5. Built application is deployed to Vercel

### Deployment Environments

- **Production**: Deployed from the main branch
- **Development**: Local development environment
- **Preview**: Vercel preview deployments for pull requests

### Monitoring and Analytics

- No specific monitoring or analytics tools are currently implemented.
- Future implementation could include tools like Google Analytics or Vercel Analytics.
- Language-specific analytics tracking will be implemented to measure performance by language.
- Error tracking will be added for production monitoring.

### Internationalization

- The application supports English and Spanish through language-based routing.
- URL patterns like `/en/` and `/es/` determine which language content to display.
- Middleware handles language detection and redirection.
- SEO is optimized with proper hreflang tags for language variants.
- Content is organized in language-specific directories for easy management.

## Security Considerations

- No sensitive data is currently stored or processed on the client.
- Form submissions will implement CSRF protection when connected to a backend.
- Content Security Policy will be implemented for production.
- Regular dependency updates to address security vulnerabilities.

## Future Technical Considerations

- Potential migration to a headless CMS for content management
- Implementation of server-side form validation and processing
- Addition of user authentication for personalized experiences
- Integration with analytics and tracking tools
- Implementation of A/B testing capabilities
- Expansion to additional languages and regions
